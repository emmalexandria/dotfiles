# Dotfiles

These are my Arch dotfiles. They are designed to be managed with the technique described in [this article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

## Installation
1. Install basic packages using `pacman -S --needed -< .pkglist`
2. Switch to Fish
3. Run `.config/grub/mkconfig.fish`
